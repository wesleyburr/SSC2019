## The Inspiration 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ![](figure/canada.png)

<br>

Health Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada are
currently funding a joint study on the risk 
between exposure to particulate matter and human health effects.

<br>

--
  - particulate matter **components**
--

  - historical component data is limited
--

  - satellite remote sensing data **may** be usable (<a href="http://www.canue.ca">**will**</a> be usable in the near future)

---

class: inverse

## The Problem

- large numbers of missing observations in the **local** data
- coarse resolution for both temporal and spatial dimensions in the
  **remotely** sensed data
- mis-match in temporal coverage

<br>
--

**Can the two be used to improve one another?**

## Area of Interest

For the purposes of this talk, we will examine data for the **Greater Toronto Area** (GTA), an
amalgamated city centered on the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

<br>

* Total population: 6.35 million people
* Geographic area: 5,903 km<sup>2</sup>
* GDP: &#36;313 billion Canadian dollars
* Air Pollution Health Impact: approximately 1,300 premature deaths and 3,500 hospitalizations annually just in the City of Toronto

---

class: inverse

## Ground-level Data Availability

Ground-level observations at an hourly level exist back to 1980 for selected locations in the GTA
for pollutants (annual averages given for 2010):

<br>

* NO<sub>2</sub> (annual average: 20 ppb), NO and NO<sub>x</sub>
* O<sub>3</sub> (annual average: 21 ppb)
* SO<sub>2</sub> (annual average: 1 ppb)

--

<br>

and back to 2001 for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (2010 annual average: 7 &mu;g/m<sup>3</sup>)

<br>

* some data is available before 2001, but it is highly erratic, and considered to be of poor quality.

## Remote sensing Data Availability

* Lengthy delays in satellite data availability from collaborators
* Replaced with Terra MODIS aerosol optical depth
* Demonstrated on Toronto area for 2012 for this talk

## Goal

Previous work developed a bivariate interpolation algorithm, allowing
the spectral structure of one time series to be used to reconstruct
missing observations in a second.

<br>

--
* Series do not have to share temporal sampling rate
* Series do not have to be necessarily correlated
* Leverages a robust estimate of the cross-spectral density

## Token Formulae

**Lots** of missing details - algebra is fairly nasty, but [code](http://github.com/wesleyburr/tsinterp/) available.

## Air Pollution - Methodology

Thus, we have a bivariate interpolation algorithm. So, given
**missing observations in the ground-level observations**
we can iterate the algorithm convergence and obtain a contiguous series by using remotely sensed data as a secondary series for the interpolator.

## Results

Thus, using satellite data, **despite** the 

<br>

* Complicated relationship (correlated, not coincident)
* Varying temporal resolution
* Missing (at random?) observations

<br>

we can derive a contiguous **ground-level** particulate matter component series.

---

class: inverse

## Then what?

We can then turn this around, and use this contiguous series to generate:

<br>

* GEOS-CHEM (chemical transport) or equivalent
* Land-Use Regression models
* Spatial fields
* Structural exploration (power spectra, EDA)

---

class: inverse

## Is this **strictly necessary**?

<br>

* Possibly not!
* Creative use of spatio-temporal statistics and field estimation may bypass need
* However, contiguous data is still required for spectrum estimation, **and**
* Scientific exploration of data is strongly aided by understanding of the periodic structure inherent in air pollution, generated as it is by humans

## Future Work

While the interpolator(s) are functionally complete, tested, and ready
for use, the application to remote-sensed data is still very much
a Work In Progress.

<br>

* Extend to spatial considerations - multiple stations simultaneously?
* Use as correction tool: given observation, delete, and interpolate - big differences imply unexpected observations (statistically)
* Complete data set (apply to all stations in Canada)
* Reverse order: use ground-level to detect and screen remotely-sensed data?
